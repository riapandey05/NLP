# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Practice – Ria Pandey

Welcome to my hands-on NLP repository! This repo documents my learning journey and practical implementation of core **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques using Python.

---

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository consists of **well-structured Jupyter notebooks** covering step-by-step NLP concepts, from basic preprocessing to more advanced vectorization and classification techniques.

Each notebook includes:
- 🔍 Code implementation with examples
- 🧪 Output demonstrations

## 🚀 Highlight Project: Sentiment Analysis on SMS Spam Dataset

One of the key projects in this repo is a **Sentiment Analysis classifier** developed from scratch. This model classifies text messages as either **spam** or **ham** (not spam).

### 🔧 Tools & Techniques Used:

- **BeautifulSoup**: For removing HTML tags from raw text
- **Regular Expressions**: To clean unwanted patterns, URLs, and symbols
- **NLTK Stopwords**: For removing common English stopwords
- **WordNetLemmatizer**: For lemmatizing text to its base form
- **CountVectorizer & TF-IDF**: For text vectorization
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: For training a text classification model
- **Train-Test Split**: For evaluating accuracy

### 📊 Project Files:
- `10spamham.ipynb`
- `11_W2V&AvgW2V[1].ipynb`
- `12sentimentanalysis.ipynb`
